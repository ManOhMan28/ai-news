    "abstract": "We introduce a general coupled system of parabolic equations with quadratic nonlinear terms and diffusion terms defined by fractional powers of the Laplacian operator. We develop a method to establish the rigorous convergence of the fractional diffusion case to the classical diffusion case in the strong topology of Sobolev spaces, with explicit convergence rates that reveal some unexpected phenomena. These results apply to several relevant real-world models included in the general system, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, the Magneto-hydrodynamics equations, the Boussinesq system, and the KellerSegel system. For these specific models, this fractional approach is further motivated by previous numerical and experimental studies.",
    "conclusion": "This question lies completely outside the scope of this article. However, we mention that, if global-in-time solutions exist for any time T > 0, the estimate (20) can also be extended to the time interval [\u03b5, T ]. See Section 3.2.2 for further details. The convergence proven in estimate (20) also allows us to establish an analogous result in other functional spaces. For instance, for certain ranges of the parameters 1 \u2264 p \u2264 +\u221e and \u03c3 > 0, we can consider the Lebesgue spaces Lp(R d ) and the Sobolev spaces W \u02d9 \u03c3,p (R d ). Corollary 1.1. With the same assumptions as in Theorem 1.1, and for fixed 0 < \u03b5 \u226a T2T2, the following estimates hold: (21) sup \u03b5\u2264t\u2264T2T2 ku \u03b1i (t, \u00b7) - u2,i(t, \u00b7)kLp \u2264 C \u03b5\u03b7 1 + T 2 \u03b7+1 T 2 max i=1 , \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n Fi Fi (|2 - \u03b1i|) , 2 \u2264 p \u2264 +\u221e , and (22) sup \u03b5\u2264t\u2264T2T2 ku \u03b1i (t, \u00b7) - u2,i(t, \u00b7)k W \u02d9 \u03c3,p \u2264 C \u03b5\u03b7 1 + T 2 \u03b7+1 T 2 max i=1 , \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n Fi Fi (|2 - \u03b1i|) , 0 < \u03c3 < s, 2 \u2264 p < +\u221e . We thus obtain a wide range of parameters p and \u03c3 for which these convergences hold. Certain values of these parameters are of particular interest, as the general coupled system (1) includes, as a special case, some real-world relevant models."

    "abstract": "World model-based searching and planning are widely recognized as a promising path toward human-level physical intelligence. However, current driving world models primarily rely on video diffusion models, which specialize in visual generation but lack the flexibility to incorporate other modalities like action. In contrast, autoregressive transformers have demonstrated exceptional capability in modeling multimodal data. Our work aims to unify both driving model simulation and trajectory planning into a single sequence modeling problem. We introduce a multimodal driving language based on interleaved image and action tokens, and develop DrivingGPT to learn joint world modeling and planning through standard next-token prediction. Our DrivingGPT demonstrates strong performance in both action-conditioned video generation and end-to-end planning, outperforming strong baselines on large-scale nuPlan",
    "conclusion": "In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal driving language that effectively unifies the visual world modeling and trajectory planning into a sequence modeling task. We design a DrivingGPT that could jointly learn to generate image and action tokens for both tasks. Experiments and ablation studies on large-scale nuPlan and NAVSIM bench-"
